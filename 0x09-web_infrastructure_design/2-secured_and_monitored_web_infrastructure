Secured Web Infrastructure Summary

Overview:
This infrastructure hosts [www.foobar.com](http://www.foobar.com) with high availability, security, and monitoring, based on a distributed model with added layers.

Components and Their Purpose:

* User: Accesses the site via browser over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
* DNS: Managed by providers like Cloudflare or AWS Route 53; directs users to the nearest CDN edge with load balancing and geo-DNS for faster response.
* CDN: Caches static content close to users, speeds delivery, and provides DDoS protection.
* Firewall and Security Layer: Includes Web Application Firewall (WAF) and network firewalls to filter malicious traffic and restrict access between components.
* Load Balancers: Distribute incoming traffic evenly to multiple application servers; redundancy ensures no single point of failure here.
* Application Servers: Run backend code; deployed across multiple availability zones for fault tolerance; do not serve static files directly.
* Database Servers: Primary-Replica setup with encrypted connections and strict access controls; replicas provide read scalability and redundancy.
* Monitoring and Logging: Tools like Prometheus and Grafana collect metrics via agents on servers, providing real-time performance insight and alerting.
* Backup and Disaster Recovery: Automated backups and snapshots stored across regions for resilience.

Why HTTPS and Firewalls?

* HTTPS encrypts all user-server communication, protecting data privacy and integrity.
* Firewalls filter traffic to block unauthorized or malicious requests, securing the network.

Monitoring Details:

* Agents/exporters collect server metrics (CPU, memory, QPS).
* Data is sent to a centralized system (e.g., Prometheus) and visualized on dashboards (e.g., Grafana).
* To monitor Web Server QPS, configure agents to track HTTP request counts and set alerts for anomalies.

Infrastructure Issues:

* SSL Termination at Load Balancer: If SSL is terminated here, unencrypted traffic travels inside the network, risking data exposure if internal security is weak.
* Single Writable MySQL Server: Acts as a single point of failure; if it goes down, writes halt, affecting availability.
* Servers with All Components: Not applicable hereâ€”servers are separated by function, avoiding resource contention and easing scalability.
