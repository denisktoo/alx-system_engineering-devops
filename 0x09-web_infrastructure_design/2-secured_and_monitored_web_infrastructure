Secured Web Infrastructure Summary - www.foobar.com

Overview:
This infrastructure hosts www.foobar.com with basic security and monitoring using a three-tier architecture.

Components and Their Purpose:
* User: Accesses the site via browser over HTTPS to ensure secure communication
* SSL Certificate: Provides HTTPS encryption for www.foobar.com domain
* HAProxy Load Balancer: Single load balancer (IP: 8.8.8.8) distributes traffic to backend servers
* Firewalls (3): Individual network firewalls protecting each server from malicious traffic
* Server 1 - Web Server: Nginx web server with application files (codebase)
* Server 2 - Application Server: Application server with application files (codebase)
* Server 3 - Database Server: Single MySQL database with backup & replication capabilities
* Monitoring Clients: Local monitoring agents installed on each server

Why HTTPS and Firewalls:
* HTTPS encrypts all user-server communication, protecting data privacy and integrity
* Firewalls filter traffic to block unauthorized or malicious requests, securing each server

Monitoring Details:
* Local monitoring clients collect server metrics (CPU, memory, network statistics)
* Each server monitors itself independently - no centralized monitoring system shown
* To monitor Web Server QPS: Configure monitoring client on Server 1 to track Nginx request logs and HTTP request counts

Infrastructure Issues:
* SSL Termination at Load Balancer: Unencrypted traffic flows between load balancer and servers, creating internal security risk
* Single MySQL Server: Only one database server can accept writes, creating single point of failure for write operations
* Component Mixing: Actually GOOD separation shown - each server has dedicated function avoiding resource contention
