Distributed Web Infrastructure Summary - www.foobar.com

A distributed web infrastructure spreads workload across multiple components to enhance performance, scalability, and reliability.

Flow Overview:
1. User enters www.foobar.com
2. DNS resolves the domain to the load balancer's IP address (8.8.8.8)
3. Load balancer distributes incoming requests to web server
4. Web server (Nginx) serves static files and forwards dynamic requests to application server
5. Application server processes business logic and interacts with the database
6. Database (Primary-Replica) manages data storage, improving read/write performance
7. Response flows back through the same path to user

Key Components and Reasons for Adding Them:
* Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes traffic and provides single entry point, uses Round Robin algorithm
* Web Server (Nginx): Dedicated server handles HTTP requests and serves static files
* Application Server: Dedicated server processes business logic and application code
* Primary-Replica Database Setup: Primary node handles writes and reads, replica provides read-only access for scaling and redundancy
* Application Files Replication: Codebase distributed across web and application servers for consistency

Load Balancer Setup Types:
* Active-Active: Multiple load balancers operate simultaneously, sharing traffic for high availability
* Active-Passive: One active load balancer handles traffic, while a standby waits to take over if the active fails
* Current Setup: Single load balancer with Active-Active configuration mentioned

Primary vs. Replica Database Nodes:
* Primary Node: Accepts all write and read requests, ensures data consistency
* Replica Nodes: Read-only copies used for query load distribution and backups

Infrastructure Issues to Note:
* Single Points of Failure (SPOF): Load balancer is single point of failure, though database has replica redundancy
* Security Concerns: No firewalls or HTTPS encryption visible in current setup
* No Monitoring: No monitoring tools shown, issues may go undetected
* Limited Scaling: Single web and application servers limit horizontal scaling capacity
