Scaled Infrastructure Summary

Overview:
A scaled web infrastructure is designed to handle higher traffic, improve reliability, and eliminate single points of failure (SPOF). It expands upon the simple one-server setup by adding redundancy, load distribution, and fault tolerance.

Components:
1. Load Balancer (LB)  
   - Role: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers.  
   - Reason for Addition: Prevents overloading a single server, improves availability.  

2. Multiple Web Servers (Nginx/Apache)  
   - Role: Serve static files and forward dynamic requests to app servers.  
   - Reason for Addition: Redundancy â€” if one web server fails, others handle the load.  

3. Multiple Application Servers  
   - Role: Run application logic, process requests, connect to the database.  
   - Reason for Addition: Parallel processing of requests, better performance, failover support.  

4. Database Replication (Primary + Replica)  
   - Role: Store application data, with the replica providing read access.  
   - Reason for Addition: Improves read performance, ensures data availability if the primary fails.  

5. Cache Server (Redis/Memcached)  
   - Role: Stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval.  
   - Reason for Addition: Reduces database load, speeds up responses.  

6. CDN (Content Delivery Network) 
   - Role: Serves static content from edge locations closer to users.  
   - Reason for Addition: Reduces latency, improves user experience globally.  

7. firewall/Security Layer  
   - Role: Filters malicious traffic before it reaches servers.  
   - Reason for Addition: Protects infrastructure from attacks, improves security.

Infrastructure Issues Prevented:
- Eliminates single points of failure.  
- Improves scalability and performance.  
- Supports high availability and disaster recovery.  
- Handles high traffic without service degradation.
