Simple Web Infrastructure Summary

Overview:
A simple infrastructure consists of a single server setup hosting the entire website. 
It is the most basic form of deployment and is suitable for low-traffic websites.

Components:
1. **Web Server (Nginx)**:
   - Handles HTTP requests from users.
   - Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS) directly.
   - Passes dynamic requests to the application server.

2. **Application Server**:
   - Runs the website's backend application code.
   - Processes business logic and interacts with the database.
   - Communicates with the web server via protocols like WSGI/ASGI.

3. **Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**:
   - Stores persistent data (e.g., user accounts, posts, orders).
   - Accessed by the application server via SQL queries.

4. **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
   - Maps the domain name (e.g., www.foobar.com) to the server's IP address.
   - Allows users to access the site using a readable URL.

5. **Single Server**:
   - Hosts all components (web server, app server, database).
   - Simplifies deployment and maintenance.

Infrastructure Issues:
- Single point of failure: If the server crashes, the entire website goes down.
- Limited scalability: Performance degrades under high traffic.
- Maintenance downtime: Updates cause full website downtime.

Why Each Element is Included:
- Web Server: Efficiently handles static files and forwards dynamic requests.
- Application Server: Processes backend logic and handles requests.
- Database: Stores and retrieves structured data.
- DNS: Converts human-readable URLs to machine-readable IPs.
- Single Server: Simplifies setup for small projects.
